        Audience. The focus on pet cards would mean my audience would be more experienced magic the gathering players. So I could use more advanced jargon to appeal to them and not need to dumb it down too much for newer players who haven’t yet had the time to come up with a pet card. 
      </p>

      <h3>[The Genie's Lamp]</h3>
      <p>
        Pet Card Search; The goal of the site will be to allow users to take a single card and be able to look up strategies and various different decks that feature the use of that card. Allowing them to make more use out of ‘pet’ cards or cards they happen to have special editions of. Many of the more experienced magic the gathering players have one or more of these pet cards. This site will allow them to better utilize these cards instead of doing the regular strategy of just trying to cram them into this or that deck. 
        I want to capitalize on the jargon of pet cards in the description and language of the site as this feature is presented to allow my site to have a more unique selling point. I would like the deck building portion to allow for the insertion of multiple pet cards. Hopefully aiding in more creative deckbuilding as the pet cards may present deck types and strategies that the user hadn’t yet considered. 
        The site will need a mass card strategy and deck list database. Something similar to the database that EDHREC.com uses but more fine tuned towards the goal of the site. It will need to be able to take a card and present options for the user to view strategies in various color combinations, game formats, and general game strategies. 
        Depending on the scope of the central database, I may have to focus on a particular game format. Which would end up being elder dragon highlander or commander. Since the single card rule affects this game format the most heavily and it would be where pet cards have the highest chance to shine.

      </ul>
      <h3>[The Vault]</h3>
      <p>
        Deck Storage and Organization; A secondary function will be to store deck information for the users. My idea is to allow a user with a large collection to have a number of decks ‘active’ all at once. This would keep track of which card, and which version, of the card is in which deck. Streamlining the process of breaking down and building new decks since the user will know which card is in which active deck. 
        The active deck part will be what is unique to other deck building sites. As a user can have any number of built decks but only so many ‘active’ decks. Allowing them to keep better track of the part of their collection that is currently in use along with which version is in which deck. An important thing to note as the list of alternate arts and secret lair drops steadily gets longer and longer. 
        A more local database to allow users to store created decks will be needed as well. I won’t have to worry about making sure it has the playtest capabilities other deck building sites offer but I will need to make sure that it has access to the various alternate cards. Including lands so that users can keep track of favorite lands. This would be a step up from just displaying which cards are in which deck as it would allow users to keep track of which version of that card is in which deck. Hopefully allowing for an optimized way to keep track of collections. The system should allow the user to easily find specific cards for swapping or cannibalizing for new decks. There should be a quick access function that allows a suggested deck from the pet card search to populate a deck into the user’s deck database.
